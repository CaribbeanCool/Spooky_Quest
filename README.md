# Spooky Quest :skull:
When compiled and run, the base game has two Areas and two types of Enemies available. To enter the game, you press any
key, and the Player will be placed in the first area. To move, use the W (up), A (left), S (down) or D (left) keys. To move on to the second area, you must battle and beat all three enemies found in Area One. You fight enemies by colliding with them and beating them at Rock, Paper, Scissors. To win the game, you
must beat all enemies in Area Two.
